## *Sean Hall the Diet Dark Knight*

Hello one and all! My name is Hall, Sean Hall.

I am a Washington boy born and raised. I was born in Everett in the year 1991 and from there I've lived in Lake Stevens, Mukilteo, Granite Falls and most importantly Everett! Along the way I've made many fond memories with my family and friends but once September of 2011 came around I had to say, "Good bye!" to my regular way of life. I enlisted into the United States Air Force. I learned how to become a C-130 Crew Cheif and gained experience in the "H Model" with two variet types, Shadows and Talons, along with the "J Model". During my seven year enlistment I saw more of the world then I ever thought I would. In the United States, for the first time, I saw Texas, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas and Arkansas then overseas I visited England, Whales, Scotland, Germany, Spain, Czech Republic and a few others. During this time I gained so many more relationships and bonds that I will forever be greatful for but I finally reached a point where I desperatley needed something different for my over all life. Which is what eventually lead me to where I am now, Code Fellows 102!

### Learning Journal

Growth Learning (Lab 01)

```markdown
"Growth Learning" in the most simple of my terms is being easy on yourself while having a positive outlook on challenging problems.

Staying in a Growth Mindset

1. My skill in coding will progress at a pace that is meant for me, others skill progression is not related to me.
2. It takes a lot to make me lose my temper with a problem and sometimes completely give up on the task. So, I need to take a deep breath before I arrive at that stage and ask for help or whatever could lead to a solution.
3. Don't be so critical on yourself, do the best work that **YOU** can do.
```

The following will be detailing what I personally learned and found useful in Code 102 on the second day of June 25th 2019.

# Notes
- **Git**
  -It is the "Stupid Content Tracker"
  -Able to check changes between files
  -It is a **version control system**
  -View, Apply, & Remove changes
  -Rollback = If something has gone wrong you are able to go back to before it became corrupted
  -Lives on the computer
  -Used inside of GitHub
  -Completely different from GitHub
- **GitHub**
  -Share code w/ others
  -Online place to store code (back up is good!)
  -Uses Git to help manage team's work:
    -Version tracking
    -Reviewing changes
    -Keep changes seperate until you want to add them together
- **Repository**
  -Collection of files thatg you've told Git to pay attention to
  -1 project = 1 repository
  -Large projects = multiple repos for different parts of system (ie. front end & back end)
  -Repos can live on GitHub &/or computer

##Key Concepts
###Git
1. Base code
2. "clone" -> pulls down a copy of the remote repo
3. "add" -> stages a file for commit
4. "commit" -> **locks** in your changes
5. "push" -> put my changes in GitHub

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

Git Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide - Notes
-Prerequisites
  -Understand Command Line for Windows and Linux
-Version Control
  -A system that allows a user to visit various areas where changes were made so that mistakes can easily be rectified
  -Local Version Control = one database on hard disk that stores changes to files
  -DVCS = Distributed Version Control systems
  -DVCS has multiple mirrored repositories so it allows for steamlined teamwork with multiple people
  -Three states of GIT
    1. Commited
    2. Modified
    3. Staged
-Getting Started  
  -GIT includes inherent Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools
  -Three ways to get more info on  particular command, by accessing the manual:
   1. git help command
   2. git command --help
   3. man git-command
-Setting up a Git Repository
  -Importing
  -Cloning
 -Workflow
  -Local Repository Structure
    -Local Git repo has three components:
      1. Working Directory: Actual files reside here
      2. Index: Area used for staging
      3. Head: Points to most recent commit
  -Committing a File
    -once one or multiple files are staged -> commit the changes & record what was done -> input: git commit -m "made change x,y,z"
  -Commiting All Changes
    -input: git commit -a
  -Pushing Changes
    -input: git push origin master
```
