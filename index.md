## *Sean Hall the Diet Dark Knight*

Hello one and all! My name is Hall, Sean Hall.

I am a Washington boy born and raised. I was born in Everett in the year 1991 and from there I've lived in Lake Stevens, Mukilteo, Granite Falls and most importantly Everett! Along the way I've made many fond memories with my family and friends but once September of 2011 came around I had to say, "Good bye!" to my regular way of life. I enlisted into the United States Air Force. I learned how to become a C-130 Crew Cheif and gained experience in the "H Model" with two variet types, Shadows and Talons, along with the "J Model". During my seven year enlistment I saw more of the world then I ever thought I would. In the United States, for the first time, I saw Texas, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas and Arkansas then overseas I visited England, Whales, Scotland, Germany, Spain, Czech Republic and a few others. During this time I gained so many more relationships and bonds that I will forever be greatful for but I finally reached a point where I desperatley needed something different for my over all life. Which is what eventually lead me to where I am now, Code Fellows 102!

### Learning Journal

The following will be detailing what I personally learned and found useful in Code 102 on the second day of June 25th 2019.

# Notes
- **Git**
  -It is the "Stupid Content Tracker"
  -Able to check changes between files
  -It is a **version control system**
  -View, Apply, & Remove changes
  -Rollback = If something has gone wrong you are able to go back to before it became corrupted
  -Lives on the computer
  -Used inside of GitHub
  -Completely different from GitHub
- **GitHub**
  -Share code w/ others
  -Online place to store code (back up is good!)
  -Uses Git to help manage team's work:
    -Version tracking
    -Reviewing changes
    -Keep changes seperate until you want to add them together
- **Repository**
  -Collection of files thatg you've told Git to pay attention to
  -1 project = 1 repository
  -Large projects = multiple repos for different parts of system (ie. front end & back end)
  -Repos can live on GitHub &/or computer

##Key Concepts
###Git
1. Base code
2. "clone" -> pulls down a copy of the remote repo
3. "add" -> stages a file for commit
4. "commit" -> **locks** in your changes
5. "push" -> put my changes in GitHub

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/seankhall/github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
